Week 6:  API assignment - What's the Weather Like?

Equator Weather Trends
- The "Temperture (F) vs. Latitude" scatter plot reveals a normal distribution with higher temperatures just north of the equator.

- The "Humidity (%) vs. Latitude" scatter plot shows a bimodal distribution with a smaller range of higher humidity temperatures immediately around the equator and a broad full range around -20 and 40 degrees latitude.  This may be due in part to a smaller sample size of cities with low humidity as they are generally less inhabitable.

- Neither cloud coverage nor wind speed showed a clear relationship from visualizations generated.
